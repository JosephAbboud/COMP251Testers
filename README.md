## How to use

### Requirements
1. Java 8 or newer
2. JUnit 5.0.0 or newer
3. A Java IDE (Any of IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode, etc.)

### Considerations
You may have your own package system in your Java Project. If you do, make sure that you drag 
and drop these files in the same package as your assignment code for each question (If you use
the regular build system) or the corresponding `test/java` directory to your assignment code
if you use the Maven build system.

## IMPORTANT NOTE!

### Disclaimer
These testers are made by myself, and thus passing all these tests does NOT guarantee that you 
will pass all the tests on Ed Lessons! These tests are just extra cases for you to check that
your code works as intended. 

Also, note that these tests may not be perfect, and thus, though unlikely, they may have some 
minor bugs

### Side Note
If you find any bugs (i.e. tests fail when you are 100% sure they should not be failing) please 
do not hesitate and feel free to reach out to me so that I can administer a quick fix.
